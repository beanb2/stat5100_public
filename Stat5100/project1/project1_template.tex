\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce the design ground snow load problem and why it is important. You may choose to cite a few sources regarding the importance of proper design ground snow loads such as the reference provided in the assignment description \citep{Arcement2017}. Some other references you may wish to include are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A reference that found mention in the media of 1,029 snow induced building failures in the United States from 1989-2009 \citep{Geis2011}.
\item A reference to the national snow load standards document, which illustrates that snow is important enough to prompt engineers to require that buildings be constructed to appropriately withstand loads \citep{ASCE2017}.
\item A reference to the report that includes the data-set being used in this project \citep{Bean2018-report}.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Briefly describe the variables of interest, including their units of measure. 
\item Provide one or two exploratory plots that show the distribution of the data as well as the relationship between ground snow and elevation. 
\item Identify any outliers that are present in the data. If you do identify outliers, be sure to describe how you handled them in the following section. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Modeling Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine whether the original regression model provided in the starter code satisfies the necessary modeling assumptions. 
\item If assumptions are violated, describe the remedial measures you took to eliminate the violations. 
\item Demonstrate that your remedial measures were successful. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Inference and Validation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine whether or not the linear relationship between ground snow and elevation is significant. 
\item Provide an interpretation for the coefficient associated with elevation in the model. 
\item Provide simultaneous prediction intervals for Park City (elevation: 2134 meters) and Logan (elevation: 1382 meters) and comment on the appropriateness of these intervals. 
\item Provide a confidence interval for your prediction at Kings Peak, Utah (elevation 4122 meters) and comment on the appropriateness of this interval. 
\item On a scale of 1-5 (1 being terrible, 5 being excellent) rate the quality of your linear model and justify your choice using two graphical and two numerical outputs. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the implications of your analysis: what do we learn about the relationship between ground snow and elevation based on your work?
\item Identify at least two future directions for research. What additional questions would be worth exploring based on your analysis? 
\item Be sure to write the introduction and conclusion in ways that an everyday reader would understand. These sections should not be overly technical. 
\end{itemize}
