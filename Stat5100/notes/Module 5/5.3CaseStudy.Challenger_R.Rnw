The January 18, 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger was investigated by the
Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident. The Commission's
1986 report attributed the explosion to a burn through of an O-ring seal at a field joint in
one of the solid-fuel rocket boosters. This 1986 launch was the 25th space shuttle launch.
After each of the previous 24 launches, the solid rocket boosters were inspected.
The following data are from the Commission's 1986 report, with the following variables:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{8cm}|}
\hline
Flight & an identifier code for the launch \\
\hline
Temp & temperature (degrees F) at launch \\
\hline
Damage & indicator of damage to the field joint (a missing value is recorded for one launch where the solid rocket boosters were not recovered) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note that seven of the 24 launches experienced field joint damage but did not explode
like the Challenger. The Challenger launch was Flight STS51L (not in these data)
and the temperature was 31.

We will follow the following steps in this case study:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Visualize the data
\item Evaluate the probability of damage based on temperature
\item Check for influential observations and outliers
\item Calculate the probability of damage at temperature 31 (temperature at Challenger launch)
\item How is logistic regression different from ANOVA?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{1. Visualize the data}

<<out.width = "0.45\\textwidth", fig.show = 'hold', fig.align='center'>>=
# We will look at the distribution of temperature by damage
boxplot(shuttle$Temp ~ shuttle$Damage, main = "Distribution of Temp by Damage",
        xlab = "Damage", ylab = "Temperature")

# Full data, still separated by temperature
damage_numeric <- as.numeric(shuttle$Damage == "YES")
plot(shuttle$Temp, damage_numeric, main = "Full Data", xlab = "Temperature at launch",
     ylab = "Damage of field joint (1.0 = YES, 0.0 = NO)", pch = 16)
@

Based upon the above visualizations, we would conclude that damage mostly occurred to the field joint at lower temperatures.

\subsection*{2. Evaluate the probability of damage based on temperature}

<<>>=
# Convert damage to factor type first
shuttle$Damage <- as.factor(shuttle$Damage)

shuttle_logreg <- glm(Damage ~ Temp, data = shuttle,
                      family = "binomial")
summary(shuttle_logreg)
@

Now, let's create a fit plot showing the probability of damage for various levels of temperature.

<<out.width = "0.6\\textwidth", fig.align='center'>>=
temp_range <- seq(50, 85, length.out = 100)
pred_prob_damage <- predict(shuttle_logreg, newdata = data.frame(Temp = temp_range),
                            type = "response")

plot(shuttle$Temp, damage_numeric, main = "Predicted probabilities for Damage=YES",
     xlab = "Temperature", ylab = "Probability")
lines(temp_range, pred_prob_damage)
@

\subsection*{3. Check for influential observations and outliers}

<<out.width = "0.6\\textwidth", fig.align='center'>>=
stat5100::logistic_influence_diagnostics(shuttle_logreg)
@

Now let's do an outlier check using the simulated envelope function. Note, however, that the optimization fails to converge for this example and thus the simulated envelope output is not reliable to use. 

<<out.width = "0.6\\textwidth", fig.align='center'>>=
stat5100::simulated_envelope_logreg(shuttle_logreg)
@

Let's print some suspect observations from the influential diagnostics to get a sense for what types of observations they were:

<<>>=
shuttle[17, ]
shuttle[4, ]
shuttle[10, ]
@

Let's try refitting a model but excluding those observations.

<<>>=
new_shuttle <- shuttle[-c(4, 10, 17), ]
new_shuttle_logreg <- glm(Damage ~ Temp, data = new_shuttle, family = "binomial")
summary(new_shuttle_logreg)
@

Note, however, that perfect separation between the 0's and 1's across temperature causes the maximum likelihood optimization to fail to converge. This causes the standard errors of the coefficients to become very unstable which ruins inference. The solution to this is to use a penalized regression version of OLS. Unfortunately, none of our visual diagnostics work for this alternative form of logistic regression. 

<<warning=FALSE>>=
# Create a design matrix. 
form <- Damage ~ Temp
model_frame <- model.frame(form, data = new_shuttle)

# glmnet requires at least two explanatory variables. We have included the 
# intercept as the "second" variable but should NEVER do this if we have 
# more than one explanatory variable to work with. 
# Alpha = 0, makes this akin to "ridge regression"
penalized_logit <- glmnet::glmnet(model.matrix(form, model_frame), 
                              model.response(model_frame), 
                              alpha = 0,
                              family = "binomial",
                              lambda = 0.001)

@

\subsection*{4. Calculate the probability of damage at temperature 31}

<<warning=FALSE>>=
predict(penalized_logit, newx = matrix(c(31, 1), ncol = 2), type = "response")
@

\subsection*{5. How is logistic regression different from ANOVA?}

<<out.width = "0.6\\textwidth", fig.align='center'>>=
anova(lm(Temp ~ Damage, data = shuttle))

summary(lm(Temp ~ Damage, data = shuttle))

# Plot the linear model:
plot(damage_numeric, shuttle$Temp, xlab = "Damage (1=YES, 0=NO)",
     ylab = "Temperature", main = "Fit plot for Temp")
abline(a = 72.125, b = -8.411)
