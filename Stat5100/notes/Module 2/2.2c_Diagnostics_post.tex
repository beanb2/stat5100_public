\question{What happens if the assumptions regarding residuals are not satisfied?}

\begin{minipage}[l][3cm][c]{\textwidth}
%\begin{comment}
\note{The p-values associated with our model rely on proper assumptions regarding the test statistics' ``sampling distributions''.}

\note{If the residual assumptions are satisfied, then the sampling distributions are wrong and the p-values are worthless.}

\question{Why would graphical checks of assumptions be preferred to numerical checks of significance.}

\begin{minipage}[l][3cm][c]{\textwidth}
%\begin{comment}
\note{Violations of assumptions occur on a spectrum, numerical tests try to force a binary decision.}

\note{Numerical tests are good to verify potential violations that you suspect based on graphical checks.}
